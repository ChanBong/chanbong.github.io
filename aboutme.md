## hello

I’m **Harsh Kumar**. I am a student at IIT Roorkee majoring in the field of [applied mathematics](https://ma.iitr.ac.in/). At IIT Roorkee, I am a senior member of the [Data Science Group](https://dsgiitr.com/) and [Vision and Learning Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io/).

Most recently, I worked as a Research Intern at Bosch. I explored contrastive learning‑based approach for patch retrieval on an unlabelled dataset of autonomous driving.

I enjoy programming and am interested in Deep Learning, Computer security and AI Art. In my free time I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58173544-harsh-kumar) and play guitar.
