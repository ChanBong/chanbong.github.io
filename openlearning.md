I learn a lot of things from the internet, which offers a huge number of resources to read/learn about almost every topic under the sun.
More often than not, I spend days filtering out useful/good content from the nearly infinite amount of sources.
Inspired by a [stranger](https://kratzert.github.io/openlearning) I will try to document whatever I find useful.
I will also try to add specific links that I have already studied in the past but may help any interested reader (or myself as lookup).
