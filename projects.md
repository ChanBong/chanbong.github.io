### Model Extraction Attack for Video Classification

> Research Project For Inter Iit Tech Meet 10.0  

- Performed Model Extraction of Video Swin Transformer and MoviNet trained on the Kinetics datasets in Black Box and Grey Box settings to obtain
competitive results in the task
- Used conditional video generator and adverserial crafting along with knowledge distillation based techniques
- Won the gold medal in the High Prep event amongst 22 IITs across India
