Hello internet !

I am a student at IITR majoring in mathematics. I always wanted to have a blog so there it is. Here is the first block of this blog. I will try to write about the things that I learn, books that I read, lessons that I learn yada yada. Mostly it will be about my metamorphosis from a normal school kid to a better student, programmer, hacker and of course a cat memer.

I am too hyperactive to stick to one thing, so it may happen that I lose intrest in this and then wake up 3 months later in cold sweat to realise that onec I had a blog.

So let's see.
